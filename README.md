**"The replication stress response suppresses mutation rates in mismatch repair deficient budding yeast and human cancers"**

## Data
The data used for analysis in the paper is protected and we cannot share it directly. However, it is possible to re-obtain the data through these instructions:

The paper is based on two data sets. One from the Hartwig Medical Foundation (HMF; https://www.hartwigmedicalfoundation.nl) and one from the Pan-Cancer analysis of Whole Genomes under ICGC (PCAWG; https://dcc.icgc.org/pcawg). In total we analysed germline and somatic genetic data across 6,057 whole genomes.

PCAWG data (ICGC study ID EGAS00001001692) may be accessed through gbGaP and ICGC DACO, as instructed on this site https://docs.icgc.org/pcawg/data/. The HMF data used in this project may be found by accession code DR-044 and can be obtained upon request at the Hartwig Medical Foundation (https://www.hartwigmedicalfoundation.nl/en).

The raw data has been curated through a series of steps, as described in the paper. 

## Scripts
We here include the scripts for curating the data, generating analysis, and generating figures/supplementary figures. Note that paths need to be updated to run the scripts in a different setup.
